# NEISS Database GUI

### This is a GUI I built for downloading NEISS datasets and applying simple
### case definitions.

### First select the years of NEISS data you would like to use

### Then press the "Load Selected Data" button on the right and wait
### The progress bar will fill and the "Datasets Loaded" will = "True"

### Set a case definition by filling in the entry fields with the indicated
### value types and press the "Count Cases" button on the right

### You can clear your case definition by pressing the "Clear Case"
### button on the right

### You can also download your datasets, with set case definition by pressing
### the "Download File" button on the right.
